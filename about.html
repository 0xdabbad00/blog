<div class="content">

<p>I am a software developer in infosec.  I've worked for .gov, .com, and on different continents.  I hope to present unbiased reflections on the infosec industry and technology here.  Most news is veiled marketing or politically charged, and I hate that, and want this to be an outlet that informs.

<p>I am interested in defense, malware, and creating solutions.
