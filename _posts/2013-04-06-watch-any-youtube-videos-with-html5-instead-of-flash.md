Some youtube videos allows you to watch them with HTML5, some give you the message "The Adobe Flash Player is required for video playback. Get the latest Flash Player".  I just discovered how to watch any video with HTML5:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzgBcSHQDAs">https://www.youtube.com/<b>watch?v=</b>kzgBcSHQDAs</a>
change the "watch?v=" to "/embed/"
