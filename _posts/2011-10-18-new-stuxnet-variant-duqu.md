<a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002255.html">F-Secure article</a> tipped me off to a new Stuxnet variant.  It also points to a well written paper by Symantec about it called <a href="http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_duqu_the_precursor_to_the_next_stuxnet.pdf">w32 duqu: the precursor to the next stuxnet</a>.  The Symantec pdf (and it's included original write-up from some unknown security company) does not mention the name of the company whose cert was stolen, but the F-Secure article notes that it was "C-Media Electronics Incorporation."
