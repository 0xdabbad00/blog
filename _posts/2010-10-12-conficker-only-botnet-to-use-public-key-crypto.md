Virus Bulletin <a href="http://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2010/slides/index.xml">posted their slides from VB2010</a> finally (not all, but a lot), and most are not too interesting, and some of the links are broken.  I found the <a href="http://www.sophos.com/security/technical-papers/digital_signature_abuse.html">paper for the digital signature presentation</a> and it states "Conficker is the only botnet to date to use public key cryptography as a means to securely deliver command and control (C&C) actions as well as to update to newer versions."  Really?  I guess it makes sense if people are able to bring down various botnets, but you'd think the bad guys would do this by now.
