As I am currently looking for employment/income (in the US or Scandinavia), I found this interesting, that Rapid7 (Metasploit's owners) are offering $100K to fund open-source security projects, as part of their <a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2011/08/22/rapid7-supports-open-source-projects-with-magnificent7-100000-fund">Magnificent7</a> Open Source Software investment fund.
