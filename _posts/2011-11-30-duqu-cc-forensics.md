Great write-up from Kaskersky in their article <a href="http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/625/The_Mystery_of_Duqu_Part_Six_The_Command_and_Control_servers">The Mystery of Duqu: Part Six (The Command and Control servers)</a>.  Although they didn't really find anything, it does show some real-world server forensics to try and figure out how the Duqu controllers got onto these servers, what they were doing there, and how they tried to cover up their tracks.
