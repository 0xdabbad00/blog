When you create languages or libraries, you have to be extra careful for people that will be using your project later.  I have to consider this for my file templates to use for <a href="http://icebuddha.com">IceBuddha</a>.  Some good advice comes from the developers behind Qt who have corrected some things in their API and described it at: <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qq/qq13-apis.html">Designing Qt-Style C++ APIs</a>

Some examples based on one of the pieces of advice from that article is at: <a href="http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2011/08/hall-of-api-shame-boolean-trap.html">hall of api shame: boolean trap</a>
