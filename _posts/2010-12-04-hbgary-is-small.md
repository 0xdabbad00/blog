An <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/print-edition/2010/11/19/
hbgary-doubles-its-staff-as-it-rolls.html">article</a> came out that HBGary (one of my favorite incident response companies) has doubled in size this year... to a whopping 36! They were previously at 18 people at the start of the year.  I seriously thought they were a hundred strong, like Mandiant, or larger.
