Zynamics has an interesting post on how they can automatically create custom signatures: <a href="http://blog.zynamics.com/2011/01/27/memoryze-vxclass-vs-zeus/">Memoryze + VxClass vs Zeus</a>.  First, it's interesting Mandiant and them seem to be teaming up (one pic shows Mandiant's Memoryze has a setting specifically for Zynamic's VxClass).  I'd like to play with VxClass sometime.
