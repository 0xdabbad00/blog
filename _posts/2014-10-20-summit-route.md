For those that have followed this blog, I want to direct you to my new blog at <a href="https://SummitRoute.com/blog/">https://SummitRoute.com/blog/</a>.  I founded the company Summit Route over a month ago for a couple of reasons, but one of which was to build an application white-listing solution, which I've complained about wanting on this <a href="http://0xdabbad00.com/2013/01/21/there-are-no-good-execution-white-listing-solutions-for-windows/">blog</a> <a href="http://0xdabbad00.com/2013/01/22/value-of-white-listing/">before</a>.  No one else makes what I think is needed, and with every retail company being slaughtered by hackers lately, I decided I was sick of replacing my credit cards and I'd fix these problems myself. :) 

My new blog includes a weekly summary of the important cyber news that has happened during the week in posts I title "Downclimb".  It also will include some original technical pieces, such as my latest post "<a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2014/10/20/modifying_code_signed_files/">Modifying code-signed files</a>".
