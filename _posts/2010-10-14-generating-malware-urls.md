<a href="http://blog.threatexpert.com/2010/10/domain-name-generator-for-murofet.html">ThreatExpert has a good post</a> on the process they use to figure out what URL's a certain malware specimen (Murofet) will call back to. They reverse engineer it, but how they actually write the program to generate the URL's is interesting.
