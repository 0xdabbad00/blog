I moved the code for <a href="http://0xdabbad00.com/project-openhips/">OpenHIPS</a> and <a href="http://0xdabbad00.com/project-icebuddha/">IceBuddha</a> to github today, and therefore I'm using git now instead of subversion.  Previously these projects were hosted on <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/openhips/wiki">assembla</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/icebuddha/">Google Code</a>, respectively.  The transition of OpenHIPS did not work as well as I would like, but that's largely due to some non-standard usage on my part.  For example, I kept some changes to YARA in the ./branches dir.  It also did not transition my tags, which is disappointing, but as the project is abandoned right now, it's not much of a concern.  So the code for OpenHIPS will be kept on assembla for history.
