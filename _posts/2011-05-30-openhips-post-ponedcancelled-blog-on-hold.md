I will be inactive for the next few months, so this blog will not be updated for a while (and has not had many updates recently).  Also, the OpenHIPS project, unfortunately is trying to solve a problem that is more difficult than was originally anticipated, and I do not have time to work on it right now, so that is also on hold, unless anyone else wants to try and pick it up.
