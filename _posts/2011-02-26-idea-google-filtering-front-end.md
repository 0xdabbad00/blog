I believe storms have been building around the house of Google ever since Jeff Atwood (from stackoverflow) called Google out by saying basically "Why are scrapers being ranked higher than stackoverflow when they're just copying our content?" (<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/trouble-in-the-house-of-google.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/trouble-in-the-house-of-google.html</a> ).  

Creating a new search engine to provide better results than Google (or bing) would require a lot of capital for all the hardware, but I think there is a market for a front-end to google to filter out the junk results and better format them, and this wouldn't require anything more than a single web server to act as a filtering proxy.
